                    <br />Pim Pullens (PhD) is MR physicist in the University
                    Hospital Ghent & Ghent Institute for functional and
                    Metabolic Imaging. He is responsible for the management of
                    three clinical MRs and one research system. Next to his
                    clinical work, he is involved in various research projects,
                    both in Ghent and internationally, on functional and
                    structural imaging in multiple organs and body parts. Pim is
                    co-lead of the Reproducibility and Standardisation workgroup
                    of COST Action PARENCHIMA (CA16103) on the development of
                    renal MRI biomarkers. After his initial training as
                    biomedical engineer in medical image processing and
                    biomedical NMR, Pim has worked both in industry (start-up
                    and small business) and in academia. His main interests are
                    functional and quantitative imaging of the brain and
                    kidneys, standardisation of MR imaging, and
                    validation/quality assurance in MRI.

                    sharing data is not common in radiology practice. Is there a
                    place for open source tools in a radiology department? What
                    are drawbacks or advantages of using open source? How to
                    deal with liabilities and regulations? What are risks and
                    benefits of sharing data? Some examples of use of open
                    source tools in our department will be shown.

                      >Open Science in the Context of Companies, Intellectual
                      Property, and Collaborative Research</b
                    ><br /><br />There is an interesting interplay between open
                    science practices in publicly funded research and
                    intellectual property and patenting in for-profit companies.
                    This especially comes to light when such research
                    institutions and companies collaborate, which is often the
                    case in MRI-related work. For example, both companies and
                    universities could be doing interesting and important work
                    together, but apparent goals might differ: for universities
                    it might be to publish papers and adhere to funding
                    criteria; for companies it might be to secure a patent and
                    monetize the work. Do these approaches necessarily
                    contradict each other? How should they co-exist (if they
                    can)? What should companies be doing, if anything, to
                    improve or interact with open science practices? What should
                    universities and research institutions be doing, if
                    anything, to engage with companies in open science
                    practices. This talk will explore these questions.

                    techniques for renal MRI. Open source invaded his heart when
                    he realized that he did not need to spend one year
                    implementing an algorithm because someone kind went the
                    extra mile and published a well-documented open-source tool
                    that others can use to their purposes. João is also involved

                    <br /><b>The Open Source Imaging Initiative</b
                    ><br /><br />MR technology is one of the most powerful
                    medical tools ever made, yet it is not available in many
                    places around the world. How can we change that? Make the
                    technology cheaper? Would be a good start, but it is not
                    enough! We need sustainable long term solutions. By applying
                    the open-source strategy it is possible to use the immense
                    potential of the research community in a more efficient way
                    by means of collaboration. This will trigger innovation,
                    customization, and cost-efficiency, but will also lead to
                    local/regional production and knowhow transfer into regions
                    that desperately need it. An open source strategy would
                    furthermore diffuse into all important areas of our
                    healthcare system, such as: technological optimization,
                    scientific progress, regulatory harmonization, democratized
                    markets, device safety, global health, education, and many
                    more. Not less than that is our vision of the Open Source
                    Imaging Initiative (OSI²) with our communication platform:
                    <a href="http://www.opensourceimaging.org./"
                      >www.opensourceimaging.org</a
                    >. We focus on sharing and not competing, because this is
                    healthier to all of us. In this presentation we will give an
                    update on the workings of OSI², what happened so far and
                    what is about to happen very soon.<br /><br /><b
                      >Spoiler alert</b
                    >: The world's first open source hardware standard will be
                    released soon and we are preparing the open source
                    documentation of a first open source hardware MRI that makes
                    quite decent images. Our efforts are on a voluntary basis
                    and we are open to all who want to join and who support our

                      Publishing and Reviewing</b
                    ><br /><br />Communicating our research is a fundamental
                    part of our work as scientists, and a duty towards the
                    society. Typically this communication happens through
                    articles published in scientific journals, after having been
                    reviewed by our peers. We will discuss several aspects of
                    scholarly communication and in particular of scientific
                    publishing and peer review. Some of these aspects are
                    (un-)surprisingly in clear contrast with the idea of science
                    as an open and collaborative public mission. Several
                    solutions and improvements have been proposed and sometimes
                    implemented over the years; on some of them there’s wide
                    consensus, on others there is not. And even when there is
                    consensus to change, the change is slow. We will explore the
                    state of the art and different future perspectives, and
                    discuss our experiences and expectations.

                    ><br /><br />Reproducible research is necessary to ensure
                    that scientific work can be trusted. By sharing data,
                    analysis code, and the computational environment used to
                    generate the results, researchers can more effectively stand
                    on the shoulders of their peers and colleagues and deliver
                    high quality, trustworthy, and verifiable outputs. This
                    requires skills in data management, library sciences,
                    software development, and continuous integration techniques:
                    skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic
                    researchers. Skills that are unreasonable, in fact, to
                    expect in one individual team member.<br /><br />The Turing
                    Way is a handbook to support students, their supervisors,
                    funders, and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible
                    research is "too easy not to do". It includes training
                    material on version control, analysis testing, collaborating
                    in distributed groups, open and transparent communication
                    skills, and effective management of diverse research
                    projects. The Turing Way is openly developed and any and all
                    questions, comments, and recommendations are welcome at our
                    GitHub repository:

                    >.<br /><br />In this talk, Kirstie Whitaker, lead developer
                    of The Turing Way, will take you on a whirlwind tour of the
                    chapters that already exist, the interactive demonstrations
                    you can use and re-use for your own research, and the
                    directions in which we're continuing to develop. All
                    participants will leave the talk knowing that "Every Little
                    Helps" when making their work reproducible, where to ask for
                    help as they start or continue their open research journey,
                    and how they can contribute to improve The Turing Way for
                    future readers.

                    Berlin and a PostDoc at the Gallant Lab in UC Berkeley.
                    Prior to her current position, Fatma was a Moore-Sloan Data
                    Science Fellow at Berkeley Institute for Data Science and a
                    fellow at the International Computer Science Institute in
                    Berkeley. She is interested in how linguistic information is
                    encoded in the brain and uses machine-learning approaches to
                    fit computational models to large-scale brain data. Her
                    current work focuses on cross-modal language representation
                    in the human brain. She did her PhD at Bernstein Center for
                    Computational Neuroscience in Berlin, where she studied
                    functional connectivity changes during conscious perception
                    in humans and got a bachelor’s and master’s degrees in
                    Computer Science from the Technical University Munich.
                    During her master’s work, Dr. Deniz worked with Dr. Christof
                    Koch at Caltech, where she studied visual saliency and
                    automated text detection. As an advocate of reproducible
                    research practices, she is the editor of the book titled
                    “The Practice of Reproducible Research”. In addition, she
                    works on improving Internet security applications using the
                    knowledge gained from cognitive neuroscience and Mooney
                    images (<a href="https://mooneyauth.org/static/index.php"
                      >mooneyauth.org</a
                    >). Her work is at the intersection between computer
                    science, human cognition, and neuroscience. She is a
                    passionate coder, baker, and loves to play the cello.

                      Data-Intensive Sciences</b
                    ><br /><br />Reproducibility in research is one of the main
                    building blocks of the scientific method. However, there is
                    rising concern about reproducibility in current scientific
                    research that reduces the reliability of published findings
                    in various domains. In this workshop, we will learn about
                    the tools and practices that will help us to improve the
                    reproducibility of our own research pipeline. Based on the
                    book
                    <a href="https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/"
                      >The Practice of Reproducible research</a
                    >, I will first introduce reproducible research workflows by
                    providing case-study examples. In the second part,
                    participants will walk through their own research pipeline
                    and create their own reproducible research workflow. In

                    ><br /><br />GIT is a tool to keep track of the successive
                    versions of your code: from different pilot experiments to
                    the final version or for different stages of your analysis
                    pipeline. A side effect of using GIT is that it can also
                    improve how you organize your code. When associated with
                    GitHub, this also facilitates collaboration with others on
                    the same codebase, automation of many tasks, and can help
                    you streamline your workflow. GIT and GitHub are potentially
                    very powerful tools but tend to have a steep learning curve
                    associated with a confusing and obscure terminology. This 2
                    hours workshop will not turn you into GIT and GitHub wizards
                    but it should 1) make the terminology less scary so that you
                    won’t be as confused when you try it on your own, 2) guide
                    you on how to version control some simple code, 3) guide you
                    on how to use some of GitHub’s functions by quikly creating
                    your own academic website (e.g.

                    and more essential tools to conduct open and reproducible
                    research. In this workshop, we will first briefly discuss
                    how these tools can facilitate transparent science. Then, we
                    will have a hands-on session where we will code in Jupyter
                    notebook using Python. We will create reproducible workflows
                    using packages that are both basic and specific for medical
                    image analysis (e.g. SimpleITK). Information and materials

                    <br />I am a PhD student at the Psychology Department of the
                    University of Amsterdam, supervised by Dr. Steven Scholte
                    and Dr. Suzanne Oosterwijk. I’m interested in the neural
                    representation of affective processes such as emotion
                    experience and (facial) emotion perception. Additionally,
                    I’m a methods nerd, interested in novel analyses and
                    statistical methods (for fMRI). Next to my research, I work
                    at the Spinoza Centre for Neuroimaging (UvA), where I
                    provide technical assistance and develop software for
                    automated data management and preprocessing (using Docker!).
                    Throughout the years, I developed a passion for open and
                    transparent (neuro)science, to which I aim to contribute
                    with various open-source projects aimed at improving
                    transparency and reproducibility.

                    <br /><b>Introduction to Docker and Binder</b
                    ><br /><br />With the 'reproducibility crisis' in psychology
                    and neuroscience, there is a trend towards publishing one’s
                    data and code along with the associated article — which is
                    great! Often, however, providing your code is not enough to
                    reproduce your analyses, as it may depend on specific
                    software versions, system requirements, or even operating
                    systems. Docker and Binder are two tools that offer a
                    solution for this! Docker allows you to specify an
                    environment (a Docker container) using a 'recipe' (a
                    Dockerfile), containing the particular (Linux-based)
                    operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 18.04), software packages
                    (FSL 6.0.1 and Python 3.6.1 with scikit-learn 0.21.3), and
                    runtime executables (entrypoint, e.g., my_analysis.py) of
                    your choice. Binder is a less 'complete' solution than
                    Docker, but definitely not less useful! With Binder, you can
                    turn your Git(hub) repository into a collection of
                    interactive Jupyter notebooks, making them instantly
                    reproducibly for anyone. In this workshop, you will get some
                    hands-on experience with writing Dockerfiles and creating
                    Docker containers in a scientific context, as well as
                    getting started with Binder. Some experience with the
                    (Linux) command line interface is useful, but not strictly
                    required.

                    ><br /><br />The arrival of Docker containers has
                    revolutionized the way software is developed, tested and
                    pushed to production. Billions of containers are spawn on a
                    weekly basis to deliver some of the most frequently used web
                    services. We unknowingly benefit from this technology doing
                    a web search on
                    <a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor">Google</a> at
                    work, on an

                    (ps. all hyperlinks direct to GitHub). But, how do we foster
                    the use of containers to boost reproducibility and
                    efficiency in the scientific realm? Following a hands-on
                    Introduction to Docker and Binder, we will briefly explore
                    some example use cases of container technology in creating
                    reproducible computational workflows and mapping them onto
                    supercomputers!

                      >Where to Go Next? The Landscape of Post-PhD Career
                      Tracks</b
                    ><br /><br />There is a growing disparity between the number
                    of new PhD graduates and the available faculty positions.
                    Effectively, most of the PhD graduates needs to find jobs
                    outside academia. Yet, there is little amount of services
                    dedicated to assisting early career researchers in
                    discovering their core competencies, in searching for
                    employers and landing their dream jobs in industry. Ideally,
                    one should anticipate the potential future market sectors
                    after completing the PhD, and focus on developing
                    transferable skills during the PhD on that basis. This
                    however, remains a rare practice in the graduate schools.
                    Therefore, in this workshop, we will assume that you have no
                    prior experience with the job market in industry. We will
                    discuss the following: the demand for PhDs in different
                    branches of industry; paycheck or entrepreneurship? Is a
                    traineeship at a company a good start after a PhD?; defining
                    your key competences, including both hard- and soft skills;
                    searching for employers who are likely to search for these
                    competences; searching for employers who share your personal
                    values; the role of networking in searching for jobs;
                    restructuring your CV and writing a competitive motivational
                    letter; preparing for job interviews.<br /><br />The
                    workshop will be interactive: we will debunk certain myths
                    related to the job market with the use of polls and quizzes.
                    Sharing personal experience by participants will be highly
                    encouraged. The goal of the workshop is to give the
                    participants the information and confidence so they can
                    further search for relevant information on their own, and
                    take their first steps towards finding their dream job in
                    industry.

                    <br />Lyuba Zehl studied Biology and Neuroscience at the
                    University of Cologne. During this time of study, she worked
                    on kinematic of insect legs during locomotion (BSc thesis,
                    supervisor: Prof. Ansgar Büschges), and the anatomical
                    cartography of auditory nuclei in the brain stem of toothed
                    whales using cluster analysis (Msc thesis, supervisor: Prof.
                    Wolfgang Walkowiak). For her doctoral studies, she switched
                    to the RWTH Aachen University and joined the Statistical
                    Neuroscience Group of Prof. Sonja Grün at the Institute for
                    Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-6) of the Jülich Research
                    Centre. In her thesis, she worked on analysing
                    multi-electrode array recordings of monkey motor cortex and,
                    in particular, on data and metadata management of complex
                    neuroscience experiments. After receiving her doctorate
                    degree (Dr. rer. nat.) in 2017, she started working as a
                    junior scientist in the curation team of the
                    Neuroinformatics Platform of the Human Brain Project (HBP),
                    located at the Jülich Research Centre as part of the Big
                    Data Analytics Group from Timo Dickscheid at the Institute
                    for Structural and Functional Organisation of the Brain
                    (INM-1) led by Prof. Katrin Amunts. Having a high
                    interdisciplinary orientation towards computational
                    neuroscience and software development for data and metadata
                    management and a broad experience in various neuroscience
                    laboratories, she focuses now on developing and implementing
                    concepts, standards and tools for neuroscience data and
                    metadata management. With her current work, she strongly
                    supports the integration of heterogeneous neuroscience data
                    into the unified data sharing platform and the interactive
                    atlas viewers of the HBP.

                      Markers of Connectivity (HBP)</b
                    ><br /><br />Across the past years, many developments arose
                    in connectivity analyses based on MRI data offering now a
                    wide range of connectivity markers. Capitalizing on this
                    wealth of neuroimaging markers, connectivity-based
                    parcellation can be used to unravel the complexity of brain
                    organization. Furthermore, large population-based
                    neuroimaging datasets with extensive psychometric
                    characterization now open promising perspectives to link
                    brain organization to behavior. In particular,
                    interindividual variability in brain’s region functional
                    connectivity can be related to interindividual variability
                    in psychometric data by using a connectivity-based
                    psychometric prediction approach. Despite some challenges
                    associated to the use of these data-driven approaches, they
                    also offer opportunities to better understand the
                    relationships between brain connectivity and human behavior.

                    Brain Project (HBP) provides access to a comprehensive,
                    multi-level Human Brain Atlas which includes different brain
                    parcellations and template spaces. In particular, it
                    integrates the 20 micron BigBrain model with 3D maps of
                    cytoarchitectonic areas and cortical layers at microscopic
                    detail, with the JuBrain probabilistic cytoarchitectonic
                    atlas which covers variability across 10+ postmortem brains,
                    as well as with a probabilistic fibre bundle atlas derived
                    from in-vivo neuroimaging studies. HBP’s brain atlases are
                    exposed through a set of web-based services that allow users
                    to discover, explore and access not only the reference
                    atlases themselves, but also a range of well curated human
                    brain data at different scales and modalities that were
                    linked to atlas regions in a well structured data
                    integration process. The most intuitive interface to these
                    atlas services is a freely accessible, web-based interactive
                    atlas viewer, which allows intuitive visual navigation of
                    brain anatomy and atlas regions in 3D, down to the
                    microscopic resolution.

                      >MR Image Registration with Elastix and Simple Elastix</b
                    ><br /><br />From multi-modality superpositioning to atlas
                    alignment, image registration plays a central role in
                    medical image analysis. In this talk/workshop, Stefan will
                    give us insights on how Elastix and Simple Elastix work,
                    applicable modalities and how to profit the most from this
                    amazing tool. During the workshop, a hands-on guided
                    practical session will demonstrate how versatile Elastix is,
                    even in novel fields, such as quantitative MRI.

                    for the analysis of MEG and EEG data with applications in
                    cognitive neuroimaging. His scientific contributions include
                    signal processing, source reconstruction, connectivity
                    analysis and statistical analysis. Furthermore, Robert is
                    interested in improving the methodological aspects of
                    cognitive neuroimaging at the meta level: he contributes to
                    the dissemination of state-of-the-art analysis methods by
                    developing open-source software, by data sharing and by
                    organizing educational and scientific workshops. His
                    contributions to the methodological advancement of the field
                    of non-invasive electrophysiology are exemplified by
                    FieldTrip, a project that he started about 10 years ago and
                    that he has been heading since. To strengthen the MEG and
                    EEG research community, Robert is not managing FieldTrip
                    only as a data analysis toolbox, but also as a platform for
                    the exchange of ideas and expertise.

                    Cognitive Neuroimaging. During his PhD he developed analysis
                    tools to analyse fMRI scans at an even finer level of
                    detail: that of the cortical layers. In doing so, he not
                    only developed the new tools for obtaining laminar signals,
                    but also applications to build graphical pipelines with

                    do we share and communicate our analysis pathways? By means
                    of a text-description in a paper, or are there other ways?
                    In this day and age where everything happens online, it
                    should be possible to leverage web technologies for
                    neuroimaging. Indeed, there is a growing number of web tools
                    to share and communicate project information, data sets, and
                    entire interactive workflows online. In this talk I will
                    discuss a variety of these projects, how to get started or
                    even involved in them, and what I believe is the future of
                    data analysis and neuroimaging.

                    ><br /><br />MR simulations based on the Bloch Equations are
                    of high educational value. Further, they serve as essential
                    tools in MRI method development, e.g. for MR sequence design
                    and protocol optimization or generating ground truth data
                    for image reconstruction and post-processing algorithms.
                    This lecture provides insight into practical implementation
                    of computer simulations based on classical MR physics.
                    Analytical solutions versus numerical implementations will
                    be discussed. Based on pictorial examples, an introduction
                    to various MRI simulator software packages will be given.
                    The JEMRIS simulation environment will serve for most of the
                    examples shown in this lecture.

                    <br />Stephan is a researcher and PhD candidate at the
                    Electrical Engineering Department of the Eindhoven
                    University of Technology in the Netherlands. His research
                    focuses on developing new acquisition and signal processing
                    methods for functional neuroimaging that allow the real-time
                    tracking and visualisation of distributed MRI brain activity
                    patterns. Stephan is passionate about making research and
                    scientific practice more transparent, rigorous, and
                    inclusive. He started the
                    <a href="https://osceindhoven.github.io/"
                      >Open Science Community Eindhoven</a
                    >, which is part of a wide Dutch network of researchers and
                    university employees that focuses on improving scientific
                    practice. He is also the founder of
                    <a href="https://openmrbenelux.github.io/">OpenMR Benelux</a
                    >, a community working on wider adoption of open science
                    principles in MRI research through talks, discussions,
                    workshops, and hackathons.

                      >Sharing GDPR Compliant Neuroimaging Research Data</b
                    ><br /><br />Personal data privacy and research data sharing
                    seem, on the surface, to be at odds. On the one hand the
                    European General Data Protection Regulation provides
                    important regulations for protecting personal information to
                    a high standard, something that we should uphold in multiple
                    facets of life. On the other hand, current principles of
                    transparency and reproducibility in research (in short, open
                    science) suggests that we should publicly share the data
                    underlying our scientific findings. This leaves us with a
                    conundrum: how do we protect the individual's privacy, while
                    allowing others to access and process their data? In this
                    talk I will provide an overview of what has been done at
                    several EU institutions to enable neuroimaging data sharing
                    under GDPR. We will also look at the progress made with a
                    collaborative and open project that aims to provide open
                    templates and resources for informed consent forms, data
                    anonymization techniques, data usage agreements, and more.
