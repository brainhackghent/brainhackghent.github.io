<h2 style="color:#004777"> How do we store your data? </h2>
<p><div style="text-align: justify">We keep your data in online documents (e.g. Google Sheets or Google Docs). In both cases, the access rights are restricted to the organizing committee of OpenMR Benelux.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align: justify">“Special categories” of particularly sensitive personal information (“Sensitive Personal Data”) require higher levels of protection. Such Sensitive Personal Data includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data.

<p><div style="text-align: justify">We do not reach out to any third parties (including your academic or professional institution) with respect to your personal data. If your application form is incomplete, we will contact you personally in order to fill in the gaps.</div></p>

<h2 style="color:#004777"> How do we use information about you? </h2>
1.  <div style="text-align: justify">If you fill in open questions in the surveys/questionnaires in order to give us personal feedback, we might further contact you in order to get more information. This information may then be used with a purpose of improving the quality of OpenMR Benelux initiatives, or to invite you to events organized by OpenMR Benelux.</div>
2.  <div style="text-align: justify">The summarized, anonymized statistics can also potentially be used to create open-access materials to be shared at our websites. This is a non-commercial activity, for informative purposes only, and aims at improving visibility of OpenMR Benelux activities.</div>
3.  <div style="text-align: justify">If you deliver specific personal information such as dietary requirements while assigning for events, this can be used to better serve you at our events.</div>

<h2 style="color:#004777"> Whom we might share your information with? </h2>

<p><div style="text-align: justify">We will retain your information for as long as is necessary to provide you with the services that you have requested from us. For instance, if you assign for a particular event, your information will be erased after the event (unless you clearly state that you wish to be informed about the next edition of the event during the registration process). If you request to become a member of our startup database, we will hold your contact information permanently until you request to remove the data from the database, or until the startup dissolves. In case of OpenMR Benelux’s dissolution, all the contact data will be erased.</div></p>
